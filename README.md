# WhoTube
## Crowdsourced directory of youtube videos browsable by who is in the video

//What components am I going to have?

//video_player
//video_list
//video_list_item
//video_details
//search
//people - We'll do this one last.

// State:
// User
// Current Video
  // Title
  // Description
  // People - This is the last thing that we'll program and we'll save it all to firebase.
// Video List
// Search Term

How are we going to build this?

1) Build out the components
2) Fill them with dummy data
3) get data from the API to flesh them out with.
4) Be able to save a video to firebase
5) Create a way to add a person to a video and update the firebase object
6) View for browsing videos based on the person
7) Users w/permissions and crap
8) ways to flag inappropriate behavior
9) ways to hell-ban users

Something like that, if I get done with step 3 I'll be happy
